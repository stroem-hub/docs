**Strøm** is a high-performance orchestration and automation platform engineered to serve as the central nervous system of your infrastructure. With a unified and programmable execution model, Strøm empowers you to manage scheduled tasks, CI/CD workflows, ETL pipelines, and system operations—all within a single, cohesive framework.

Whether you're automating routine maintenance, orchestrating complex data pipelines, or streamlining deployments, **Strøm delivers** the reliability, scalability, and flexibility modern systems demand. Built with modularity and extensibility in mind, it provides the tools you need to adapt it to your unique environment.

> ⚠️ **Early Development Notice**  
> Strøm is currently in **active development**. The public API, configuration formats, CLI behavior, and underlying architecture are **unstable and subject to change**. While the foundation is being laid, we recommend using it cautiously in production environments until it matures.

## Why Strøm?

Modern infrastructure demands a robust yet adaptable solution to handle diverse workloads. Strøm aims to bridge the gap between task scheduling, workflow orchestration, and operational automation.

Unlike traditional cron schedulers or heavyweight orchestration frameworks, **Strøm is**:
- ⚡ **Lightweight and composable**
- ☁️ **Designed for both cloud-native and hybrid environments**
- 🔌 **Extensible without boilerplate or vendor lock-in**

By combining simplicity with powerful capabilities, Strøm enables teams to:
- Orchestrate infrastructure and data workflows seamlessly.
- Automate both routine tasks and mission-critical operations.
- Extend functionality through plugins and adapters tailored to specific needs.

Think of Strøm as a conductor for your systems—bringing harmony to the chaos of distributed processes.

## Project Goals

Strøm is being built with the following objectives:

- **Unified Orchestration**: Manage scheduled tasks, pipelines, and operations in one platform.
- **High Performance**: Execute workloads efficiently, even at scale.
- **Modular Architecture**: Leverage standalone components like the server, worker, and CLI.
- **Extensibility**: Customize and integrate with plugins and adapters for diverse use cases.

## Current Status

Strøm is in the **prototyping phase**. The core system is taking shape, but some features may be incomplete, experimental, or non-functional. As we refine the design and iterate on the architecture, **breaking changes are expected**.

This is an exciting time to get involved—whether through testing, feedback, or contributions—as the project evolves.
