# Introduction to Strøm ⚡

**Strøm** is a high-performance orchestration and automation platform engineered to serve as the central nervous system of your infrastructure. With a unified and programmable execution model, Strøm empowers you to manage scheduled tasks, CI/CD workflows, ETL pipelines, and system operations—all within a single, cohesive framework.

Whether you're automating routine maintenance, orchestrating complex data workflows, or streamlining deployment pipelines, Strøm is designed to deliver reliability, scalability, and flexibility. Built with modularity and extensibility in mind, it provides the tools you need to adapt it to your unique environment.

> ⚠️ **Early Development Notice**  
> Strøm is currently in **active development**. The public API, configuration formats, CLI behavior, and underlying architecture are **unstable and subject to change**. While the foundation is being laid, we recommend using it cautiously in production environments until it matures.

## Why Strøm?

Modern infrastructure demands a robust yet adaptable solution to handle diverse workloads. Strøm aims to bridge the gap between task scheduling, workflow orchestration, and operational automation. By combining a lightweight design with powerful capabilities, it enables teams to:
- Orchestrate infrastructure and data workflows seamlessly.
- Automate both routine tasks and mission-critical operations.
- Extend functionality through plugins and adapters tailored to specific needs.

Think of Strøm as a conductor for your systems—bringing harmony to the chaos of distributed processes.

## Project Goals

Strøm is being built with the following objectives:
- **Unified Orchestration**: Manage scheduled tasks, pipelines, and operations in one platform.
- **High Performance**: Execute workloads efficiently, even at scale.
- **Modular Architecture**: Leverage standalone components like the server, worker, and CLI.
- **Extensibility**: Customize and integrate with plugins and adapters for diverse use cases.

## Current Status

Strøm is in the prototyping phase. The core system is taking shape, but some features may be incomplete, experimental, or non-functional. As we refine the design and iterate on the architecture, **breaking changes are expected**. This is an exciting time to get involved—whether through testing, feedback, or contributions—as the project evolves.
